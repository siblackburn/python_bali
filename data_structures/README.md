Day 2: Data Structures
======================


## Intro

The goal for the day is to learn about the inner workings of some elementary data structures. We will study them in class and then you will implement them yourself.

We will cover:

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List


## Assignment

### Step 1

Today your goal is to implement the data structures covered in class.

You should provide a full implementation with correct code, code comments and doc strings as well as unit tests to ensure your code works.

Start with implementing the Stack data structure.

Implement `stack.py` and test your implementation in `test_stack.py` (there is a sample test in there to get you started).

Repeat for the remaining data structures.

This challenge (and others to come) is a great opportunity for breaking into a separate repository on github to add to your profile.

### Step 2

Implement a `reverse()` method on each of your datastructures. This method should produce a new data structure with the order of the elements reversed.


Happy Hacking!
