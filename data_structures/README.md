Day 2: Data Structures
======================


## Intro

The goal for the day is to learn about the inner workings of some elementary data structures. We will study them in class and then you will implement them yourself.

We will cover:

- Stack
- Queue
- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List


## Assignment

### Step 1

Today your goal is to implement the data structures covered in class.

You should provide a full implementation with correct code, code comments and doc strings as well as unit tests to ensure your code works.

Start with implementing the Stack data structure.

Implement `stack.py` and test your implementation in `test_stack.py` (there is a sample test in there to get you started).

Repeat for the remaining data structures.

This challenge (and others to come) is a great opportunity for breaking into a separate repository on github to add to your profile.

### Step 2

Implement a `reverse()` method on each of your datastructures. This method should produce a new data structure with the order of the elements reversed.

### Step 3

Extend the above work to the following data-structures:

*Use Test-Driven Development*

- Dictionary
- Sets

Take the time to make a nice repository of your work if you have not done so already. With a nice README that describes each data structure. Post it to your public github.

Also, learn how to run a coverage report of your unit tests: https://coverage.readthedocs.io. Adding the coverage report to GitHub is always a good idea.

### Step 4 (Advanced)

- Implement a tree data structure

### Step 5 (Master Level)

- Implement Depth first search
- Implement Breadth first search

### Step 6 (Go home, you're a coder!)

- Implement a graph data structure
- Implement an algorithm that finds the shortest path between any two nodes

Happy Hacking!
